# My .vimrc

This is my .vimrc I use for my vim configuration, mainly for C++, Markdown and
Text editing.

A lot of the customisations have come from Vimrc1234567, as well some of my own.

Vimrc1234567 is a  great package that automatically installs some very useful 
plugins and takes care of some the configuration for you.
