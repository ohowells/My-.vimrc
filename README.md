# My .vimrc

This is my .vimrc, I mainly use vim for C++, Markdown and Text editing.

A lot of the customisations have come from Vimrc1234567 by @Anthony1234567, as
well as a couple of my own.

Vimrc1234567 is a great package that automatically installs some very useful
plugins and even takes care of some of the configuration for you. making it very
easy to vim up and running.

Copy and paste this into a terminal window:
