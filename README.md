# My .vimrc

This is my .vimrc, I mainly use vim for C++, Markdown and Text editing.

A lot of the customisations have come from Vimrc1234567 by @Anthony1234567, as
well as a couple of my own.

Vimrc1234567 is a great package that automatically installs some very useful
plugins and even takes care of some of the configuration for you. making it very
easy to vim up and running.
